/* Programming Assignment 2: Exercise C
 *
 * In this third and final set of exercises, you will experiment with
 * preemptive scheduling.  We now return to the file mykernel2.c, and study
 * the procedures that were briefly mentioned but not discussed in detail
 * in Exercise B.
 *
 * HandleTimerIntr () is called by the kernel whenever a timer interrupt
 * occurs.  The system has an interval timer that can be set to interrupt
 * after a specified time.  This is done by calling SetTimer.  Notice that
 * the first thing that HandleTimerIntr does is to reset the timer to go off
 * again in the future (otherwise no more timer interrupts would occur).
 * Depending on the policy (something for you to think about), it may
 * then call DoSched, which informs the kernel to make a scheduling
 * decision at the next opportune time, at which point the kernel will
 * generate a call to SchedProc to select the next process to run, and
 * then switch to that process.
 *
 * MyRequestCPUrate (int pid, int n) is called by the kernel whenever a
 * process identified by pid calls RequestCPUrate (int n), which is a system
 * call that allows a process to request that it should be scheduled to run
 * n out of every 100 quantums (i.e., n% of the time).  For example, if a
 * process wants to run at 33% of the CPU's execution rate, it can call
 * RequestCPUrate (33), asking that it run 33 out of every 100 quantums.
 * When a process calls RequestCPUrate (n), the kernel is entered, and the
 * kernel calls your MyRequestCPUrate (pid, n), giving you the opportunity
 * to implement how proportional share is to be achieved.
 *
 * MyRequestCPUrate (pid, n) should return 0 if successful, and -1 if it
 * fails.  MyRequestCPUrate (pid, n) should fail if n is invalid (n < 1 or
 * n > 100).  It should also fail if a process calls RequestCPUrate (n)
 * such that it would result in over-allocating the CPU.  Over-allocation
 * occurs if the sum of the rates requested by processes exceeds 100%.
 * If the call fails (for whatever reason), MyRequestCPUrate (n) should
 * have NO EFFECT, as if the call were never made; thus, it should not
 * affect the scheduling of other processes, nor the calling process.
 * (The example below illustrates what happens when a request fails.)
 * Note that when a process exits, its portion of the CPU is released
 * and is available to other processes.  A process may change its allocation
 * by again calling RequestCPUrate (n) with a different value for n.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If the sum of the requested rates does not equal 100%, then
 * the remaining fraction should be allocated to processes that have not
 * made rate requests (or ones that made only failing rate requests).  This
 * is important, as a process needs some CPU time just to be able to execute
 * to be able to actually call RequestCPUrate (n).  A good policy for
 * allocating the unrequested portion is to spread it evenly amongst processes
 * that still have not made (or have only made failed) rate requests.
 *
 * Here's an example that should help clarify the above points, including
 * what to do with unrequested CPU time and what happens when requests fail.
 * Consider the following sequence of 5 processes A, B, C, D, E, F entering
 * the system and some making CPU requests:
 *
 *	- A enters the system: A is able to use 100% of the CPU since there
 *	  are no other processes
 *	- B enters the system: B shares the CPU with A; both get an equal
 *	  amount, 50% each
 *	- B requests 40%: since there is at least 40% unrequested (in fact,
 *	  there is 100% unrequested), B gets 40%; A now gets the remaining 60%
 *	- C enters the system: it shares the unrequested 60% with A (both
 *	  get 30%)
 *	- C requests 50%: since there is at least 50% unrequested (in fact,
 *	  there is 60% unrequested), C gets 50%; A now gets the remaining 10%
 *	- D enters the system: it shares the unrequested 10% with A (both
 *	  get 5%)
 *	- D requests 20%: the request fails, and so D is treated as if it
 *	  never made the request; A and D continue to share 10% (both get 5%)
 *	- D requests 10%: since there is at least 10% unrequested (in fact,
 *	  there is exactly 10% unrequested), D gets 10%; A now gets the
 *	  remaining 0%, i.e., it does not get any CPU time
 *	- E enters the system: it shares the unrequested 0% with A (both
 *	  get zero CPU time, i.e., neither can run)
 *	- D exits, freeing up 10%, which A and E now share (A and E both
 *	  get 5%)
 *	- A exits, and so E gets the remaining 10%
 *	- E exits, and now there are only processes B (which is getting 40%)
 *	  and C (which is getting 50%).  These processes have no expectation
 *	  of additional CPU time, so the remaining 10% may be allocated any
 *	  way you want: it can be allocated evenly, proportionally, randomly,
 *	  and even not at all! As long as a process gets (at least) what it
 *	  requested, the kernel considers it satisfied.
 *
 * SetTimer (int t) will cause the timer to interrupt after t timer ticks.
 * A timer tick is a system-dependent time interval (and is 10 msecs in the
 * current implementation).  Once the timer is set, it begins counting down.
 * When it reaches 0, a timer interrupt is generated (and the kernel will
 * automatically call HandleTimerIntr).  The timer is then stopped until a
 * call to SetTimer is made.  Thus, to cause a new interrupt to go off in the
 * future, the timer must be reset by calling SetTimer.
 *
 * GetTimer () will return the current value of the timer.
 *
 *
 * Exercises
 *
 * 1. Set the TIMERINTERVAL to 1, and run the program below using the three
 * existing scheduling policies: ARBITRARY, FIFO, and LIFO.  What is the
 * effect on the outputs, and why?
 *
 * 2. Implement the ROUNDROBIN scheduling policy.  This means that each
 * process should get a turn whenever a scheduling decision is made.  For
 * ROUNDROBIN to be effective, the timer interrupt period must be made small
 * enough.  Set the TIMERINTERVAL to 1 (the smallest possible value).  You
 * should then see that the outputs of the processes will be interleaved,
 * as in: 1234123412341234123412341234123412341234 (not necessarily perfectly
 * ordered as shown.  Why?  Hint: Distinguish between a fixed amount of time
 * and the execution of enough instructions to print out a character).
 *
 * 3. Try larger values for TIMERINTERVAL, such as 10 and 100.  What is the
 * effect on the interleaving of the output, and why?
 * 
 * 4. Implement the PROPORTIONAL scheduling policy.  This allows processes to
 * call RequestCPUrate (n) to receive a fraction of CPU time equal to n%,
 * i.e., roughly n out of every 100 quantums.  For example, consider the
 * four processes in the program below, where process 1 requests 40% of
 * the CPU by calling RequestCPUrate (40), process 2 requests 30% of the
 * CPU by calling RequestCPUrate (30), process 3 requests 20% of the CPU
 * by calling RequestCPUrate (20), and process 4 requests 10% of the CPU
 * by calling RequestCPUrate (10).  With TIMERINTERVAL set to 1, this
 * should ideally produce an interleaving of the processes' outputs where
 * ratio of characters printed by processes 1, 2, 3, and 4, are 4 to 3 to
 * 2 to 1, respectively.  A sample output is as follows:
 * 121312412312131241231213124123121312412312132423232423343343343444444444
 * NOTE: THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE, YOUR OUTPUT MAY DIFFER FROM THIS!
 *
 * Your solution should work with any number of processes (up to MAXPROCS)
 * that have each called RequestCPUrate (n).  You should allow any process
 * to call RequestCPUrate (n) multiple times, which would change its share.
 * RequestCPUrate should fail if n < 1 or n > 100, or if n would cause the
 * overall CPU allocation to exceed 100%.  If the call fails, then it should
 * have no effect (as if the call were never made).  For any process that
 * does not call RequestCPUrate, that process should get any left-over cycles
 * (unless 100% were requested, then it would get none).
 *
 * A good solution will have the following properties:
 *
 * 1. After a process successfully calls RequestCPUrate (n), that process
 * should utilize n% of the CPU over the time period measured from when the
 * call is made to when the process exits (or when a new successful call is
 * made, at which point a new period of measurement begins; if the call is
 * not successful, then the prevous request remains in force).
 *
 * 2. 100 ticks will be used as the maximum allowable time over which the
 * target n CPU utilization must be achieved.  Furthermore, you will be
 * allowed a 10% slack in how close you come to n% from the low end,
 * meaning that your solution will be considered correct if the actual
 * utilization of each process is at least 90% of its requested n.
 * So, for example, if a process requests and is allocated 50%, it is
 * acceptable for the measured utilization to be as low as 45% (and there
 * is no limit as to how much above 50% it gets, especially considering
 * that it may also receive free CPU time not requested by any process).
 *
 * 3. Unused CPU time should be EQUALLY distributed to any remaining
 * processes that have not requested CPU time.
 *
 * 4. You should avoid the repeated use of floating point operations, which
 * can be expensive if done every tick.  Using approximations for your
 * calculations based on using mostly integer operations is recommended.
 * (However, a working solution that uses floating point operations is
 * better than a non-working solution that avoids them, so get something
 * working first, and then optimize it.)
 *
 *
 * You must turn in your version of mykernel2.c, with all the scheduling
 * policies implemented.  You should set TIMERINTERVAL to 1, which should
 * work with ALL of your policies.
